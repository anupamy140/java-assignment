# üõí OrderUp - Reliable Product Ordering API

**OrderUp** is a robust, production-grade **Spring Boot REST API** designed to handle product orders with guaranteed **thread-safety**, **centralized exception management**, and **comprehensive test coverage**. Built with a focus on clean architecture and consistent API behavior, it ensures that stock levels are updated safely, even under concurrent access.

## üöÄ Core Capabilities

- üßæ Submit product orders via a REST endpoint.
- üîê Prevent overselling through thread-safe stock deductions.
- üßº Clean JSON error responses powered by centralized exception handling.
- üß± Clear separation of concerns using DTOs.
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive unit and integration testing with >80% coverage using **JaCoCo**.

## üß† Architecture Breakdown

### üéØ Controller: `OrderController`

- Exposes `/orders` POST endpoint.
- Accepts `OrderRequest` payload and returns `OrderResponse`.
- Delegates all business logic to the service layer.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Service: `OrderService`

Handles all business rules:

- Verifies product existence.
- Checks available stock.
- Deducts quantity using thread-safe logic.

> üßµ **Concurrency Safe**:  
> Critical stock updates are wrapped in a `synchronized` block (or handled via DB-level transactions) to prevent race conditions.

### üß© Model Layer

- `Product` entity represents persisted data.
- `OrderRequest` and `OrderResponse` act as clean transport models for the API.

### üö® Error Handling: `GlobalExceptionHandler`

Centralized using `@RestControllerAdvice`, it captures and formats exceptions such as:

- `ProductNotFoundException` ‚Üí `404 Not Found`
- `InsufficientStockException` ‚Üí `400 Bad Request`
- Generic exceptions ‚Üí `500 Internal Server Error`

All errors follow a consistent structure for client-side clarity.

## üîÅ Order Processing Flow


### üì• Example Request
Client ‚Üí OrderController ‚Üí OrderService ‚Üí Product Repository ‚Üí Response

POST /orders
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "productId": 1,
  "quantity": 2
}
üì§ Example Success Response
{
  "orderId": 101,
  "productId": 1,
  "quantity": 2,
  "status": "CONFIRMED"
}

‚ùå Example Error Response
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-14T10:30:45Z",
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Product not found"
}
üß™ Testing Strategy
üîπ Unit Tests

Validate business rules in OrderService.

Simulate error scenarios like missing products or insufficient stock.

üîπ Integration Tests

Use MockMvc to test full HTTP lifecycle.

Validate both success and failure cases through simulated POST requests.
